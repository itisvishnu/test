I'd rather die than be born a woman,1
However I've never met a woman engineer who wasn't useless.,1
The job she is working is good but who is taking care of the children?,1
His wife is working overtime. I wonder when he will get his dinner,1

She does a good job for a female manager,1
She will be a good wife someday,1
She is great at her job but she is so unladylike sometimes,1

Its better to let women be in charge of the family and men be in charge at the workplace,1
"Are you sure, being a woman you are capable of not letting your feelings interfere in the process?",1
There's no point in promoting her as she will most likely quit as soon as she gets married,1
She is engaged and who knows when she will leave the city with her husband to support his career?,1
Women can't do that due to their personal responsibilities,1
Women leaders are like mothers to their sub-ordinates,1
Women care too much about other people's feelings to take rational decisions,1
Do you think as a woman leader she will ever have the guts to fire someone?,1
A man will do that with no second thoughts,1
Day care in workplace means no woman will ever work properly as they will play with their babies at work,1
Women are already given maternity leave and now they are demanding leaves for their cycles,1

"Hate to tell you this guys, but ANY woman can scream rape, and you will be face down in handcuffs fast enough",1
We can't have her embarass us with such unprofessional dressing,1
Everyone knows women can't do that,1
We will select a man as a co-head along with her to reduce the risk of losses,1
Let's assign women leaders to less demanding projects,1
"women cant see past their own emotions,",1
A man will pay $20 for a $10 item he needs. A woman will pay $10 for a $20 item that she doesn't need.,1
You never can tell what a woman will say;,1
"We don't need women bossing us around at work, they do enough of that at home",1
"Men have succeeded for centuries without women interfering, let alone taking important decisions",1
It's so unprofessional that she schedules all the meetings according to her baby's schedule?,1
This is why you need men leaders,1

Although I have read 1 thing I always thought.,0
The sport can either be "theatrical" or competitive.,0
The theatrical side comes to my mind when I think wrestling.,0
"That probably drives people that properly wrestle mad, that they are not taken seriously.",0
I like the turkish.,0
They wrestle in olive oil!,0
!,0
"Seems like a waste of olive oil, they should use cheaper stuff, like the budget brand from the supermarket.",0
LOL  The good 'ole wesson oil!!,0
Wonder if honest abe wrestled in oil.,0
Isn't oil good for a beard?,0
"So is XFL a mixture of NFL and wrestling, or is just a lower form of football?",0
Don't know.,0
It is a football I believe.,0
"To be honest I'm not interested in football, so I can't imagine getting excited about another league.",0
There must be some gimmick to get people involved?,0
Not much of a football fan here either.,0
Wasn't aware that there are no rules against females in the football league.,0
Maybe that will be the gimmick?,0
"I'm glad my kids have no interest in football, I want my son to be active but not the expense of his brain.",0
It's a tough sport for sure.,0
Guess there are risks in all sports though.,0
Except maybe swimming.,0
As long as you're not with piranhas.,0
"Maybe bowling too, were we in the sixties it sounds like there was money in it, not sure about now.",0
That 's  a surprising trivia fact for me.,0
Don't even see any bowling alleys anymore.,0
Was enjoyable too.,0
"A mix of wrestling and bowling would be an interesting concept, I could see if Vince McMahon is interested.",0
LOL  Played in the Audi Field with car racing!,0
!,0
"Yeah, lets get as much involved as possible, it's like fusion cooking but for sports.",0
Unlike the NFL we could a written rule saying women have to play.,0
The year of woman..Why not?,0
Nice chatting with you!,0
!,0
"You too, I'm going to grab the olive oil, not saying what for cooking or wrestling.",0
Have a good day.,0
Bye.,0
U2  thank you,0
Have you heard of xfl?,0
I have.,0
I watched it in 2001,0
They are relaunching in 2020 and will have 8 cities that will host franchises.,0
I heard.,0
I hope it goes better this time,0
"Hopefully so, it is supposed to be different than the 2001 run.",0
"They are going to be looking for players released from the NFL, so maybe there will be better playing.",0
Yeah.,0
"It was interesting I guess with He Hate Me and all that, but the actual football was terrible",0
I think it will be hard to compare to the NFL.,0
Most people want to watch really good players playing good football.,0
That's true.,0
They'll definitely need to keep some of the entertainment stuff involved to keep people engaged,0
They are trying to get away from the WWE and I think this could come back to hurt them.,0
"They need something else to attract viewers, especially since the NFL is around.",0
I dunno.,0
"I kind of agree with getting away from the WWE, but only if they can replace that with something entertaining.",0
It's a fine line,0
"Right, they will definitely need that entertainment factor.",0
Yeah.,0
The list of cities is interesting.,0
Nothing in the midwest,0
I think they are signing with United to use some of the stadiums.,0
I guess they are looking for cities that will have a larger fan base.,0
What do you mean by United?,0
"The United league, Soccer.",0
"Oh, I'm not familiar with that.",0
Is that what MLS is known as?,0
The United has a lot of good teams!,0
Atlanta United is one of them!,0
Oh cool.,0
The only United I know is Manchester :),0
"Hopefully they will be able to work out the scheduling issues for when soccer, football, and xfl overlap.",0
Yeah.,0
They could offset the NFL and XFL seasons as a start.,0
Help with scheduling and attendance,0
That is a good idea.,0
That can help with the wear and tear on the field as well.,0
"Yeah, not a bad idea overall",0
"There is enough funding for them for 5 years, so hopefully they can become figure something out and make it become successful.",0
Yeah I wouldn't mind an alternative to the NFL.,0
Hopefully it works out,0
"I hope so, too!",0
We will see!,0
"Hi, how are you?",0
I am well thank you.,0
Do you enjoy the NFL by any  chance?,0
I do like the NFL.,0
I also know that Derwin James is going to wing the rookie defensive player of the year so it is pretty much an easy choice at this point.,0
Congratulations to him.,0
He deserves it.,0
I can't there are 32 teams and we end up with the Patriots in the Superbowl again.,0
That's upsetting.,0
You're not a Pats fan?,0
Do you like the NFL?,0
No.,0
I don't like the cheating scandals and even more than that I'm just sick of seeing them in the Superbowl.,0
It's boring at this point.,0
I do like the NFL.,0
Did you know that there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay in a game on average?,0
"Wow, that's not a lot.",0
Who is your favorite team?,0
I am a Bears fan.,0
They actually had a good season this year until that playoff game messed it all up.,0
How about you?,0
Me too!,0
It was a nice year!,0
I was shocked they did that well.,0
"Since our draft pick went to OAK, I wanted them to do well since our draft position would be unaffected.",0
Yes they did very well.,0
Mack was a great addition.,0
Did you know that the NFL has no written rules prohibiting female players?,0
Seems like they are trying not to be sexists but the objectification of their cheerleaders seem counter to that goal.,0
Yes it does.,0
I know that Saints cheerleaders can't eat in the same restaurant as players and if they are there first an a player enters they have to leave.,0
That's very upsetting.,0
Yeah.,0
I wonder how much an older white guy being owner affects that?,0
Tom Benson has a conservative viewpoint.,0
I'm not sure but it's crazy to me.,0
Who cares if they eat at the same place?,0
I did not know that they use tracking chips in players shoulder pads and footballs.,0
I wonder why they use replays to make calls then?,0
I know.,0
I was watching the Australian open and was amazed at the timeliness and speed of their challenges.,0
Seems like the NFL has a ways to go!,0
That seems to be the case.,0
Were you aware that ESPN created the yellow line that we see onscreen showing the marker for first down?,0
I think I knew that.,0
I thin they won an emmy for it...,0
Yes they did.,0
I can't imagine watching a game without it.,0
"Since we discussed the Patriots earlier, Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled a football his entire career.",0
I don't know how that is possible.,0
I don't know why he is not employed then!,0
I love the yellow line.,0
"I remember telling my wife that they had guys move it on everyfirst down, hoping the players didn't trip over it...",0
"Ha ha, that's funny.",0
I can't believe that in the 60's bowlers made more than NFL players!,0
I didn't know it was ever that popular.,0
Right?,0
Nice chatting with you!,0
So do you watch much football?,0
I enjoy watching NFL from time to time.,0
They have 32 teams.,0
I do like the NFL.,0
"My favorite team is one of the AFC teams, the Baltimore Ravens.",0
They have a 17 week season that runs from early September to later in December.,0
I wonder if they are pretty tired by the end of the season.,0
I would think.,0
Maybe those fancy sensors and tracking chips they have embedded in their shoulder pads could give some insight.,0
Did you know that an average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live play.,0
I didn't know that.,0
It certainly seems much longer.,0
The NFL is coming up on a 100 year anniversary in not too long.,0
They started in 1932.,0
wow I didn't know it had been that long.,0
The biggest game is at the end of the season called the Super Bowl.,0
Right!,0
And it's normally played on the first Sunday in February.,0
It's played by one of the two leagues in the NFC and AFC,0
The Super Bowl is pretty amazing.,0
It's such a spectacle.,0
Hard to believe the first NFL playoff game was played on a dirt field.,0
I read that that average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an NFL player and an average MLB player,0
Doesn't surprise me.,0
Many NFL careers are quite short.,0
The league does generate a ton of money though.,0
Even college football is about the cash.,0
14 of the 25 largest stadiums belong to College football teams.,0
Wow thats crazy!,0
I read something strange about the New Orleans Saints.,0
Apparently the cheerleaders can't eat in the same restaurant as the football players,0
That hardly seems fair.,0
I guess it is what it is though.,0
I find it interesting that those huge American Flags can weigh up to 1100 pounds.,0
No way!,0
That's a lot!,0
"It even says that if they are already eating there and a football player walks in, they are required to leave.",0
Seems strange.,0
For sure.,0
"I like football, but also chess too.",0
Do you play?,0
I think it would be interesting to see the 3 player chess game.,0
I actually have never played.,0
I did see though that there are more possible moves in a game of chess than there are atoms in the known universe.,0
Do you think thats true?,0
I find that hard to believe.,0
"I've been playing since I was a kid, but don't play too often anymore.",0
I never knew that each pawn used to have it's own name.,0
I read that the president of the world chess federation believes that chess was invented by aliens.,0
LOL,0
That's just crazy.,0
Some magicians are quite good at chess.,0
I saw that the chess grandmaster Judit Polgar beat a family friend at age 5 without looking at the board.,0
Crazy!,0
That is crazy.,0
"Well, it's been nice chatting with you.",0
yes good chatting with you as well,0
"Hello, have you heard of the Redskins before?",0
hi how are you?,0
the redskins?,0
a football team?,0
"Yeah the same one, they have the 13th pick it seems",0
does that position them well for the following season?,0
13th doesnt seem bad or good.,0
"I think its good, it can be worse, I hear ther are in the lookout of a great QB being in position 13th might ruin their chances",0
i guess they can trade up if they need to.,0
who was/is the current qb?,0
alex something?,0
"Not sure about that, they do draft Jonathan Allen last season his a great player but they still need others",0
who i j allen?,0
is he the next greatest qb?,0
"Not sure his positiion he is #17 of the team though, theres also Sean Tyler another promosing talen",0
i dont follow football much.,0
what do you think of women in the nfl?,0
I think they would be at a dissadvantage theres no rule against them paying but it would be kind of unfair and dangerous for them,0
"yeah, i agree.",0
not much point really.,0
what does it prove?,0
"maybe as a kicker, but still, what does that prove?",0
"Maybe as a kicker yeah, they should have their own devision, now thats something I would watch",0
"i think that it would be good to start the game at the high school level, build interest and a number of players.",0
then see how things go.,0
"Maybe some day, so do you like to play chess?",0
i used to play a bit.,0
i was an interesting game.,0
now i dont.,0
You?,0
"I like it, a board with 64 squares and a 8x8 grid, there are a lot of moves and strategies so cool game",0
"yeah, it is a simple game with complex strategy.",0
that is the best part.,0
"easy to learn rules, but no limit to the possibilities.",0
There are more games in the game that atoms in the known universe how crazy is that,0
that sounds about right.,0
i cant imagine any two games going the same way.,0
"anyway, great chat!",0
"I think im going to play chess now, its been great chatting with you as well, have a nice morning.",0
hi how are you?,0
what do you think of the game of chess?,0
I think it is a really complex game.,0
There are more moves in chess than atoms in the universe,0
it is complex.,0
I played a bit when I was young.,0
I don't play now.,0
I think it takes tremendous concentration.,0
There's a grandmaster who was able to win a game without looking at the board at age 5,0
"Man, some people just have a gift for the game.",0
it really requires a certain mindset.,0
"some people think math is related to chess ability, but I don't think so.",0
A 2007 study discovered a negative correlation between iq and chess skill,0
That would make sense.,0
i think that IQ tests do not capture the intelligence of chess.,0
What do you think of chess being invented by aliens?,0
That is a silly idea.,0
the board is simple.,0
the pieces are simple.,0
"the complexity comes from the possibilities, not from aliens.",0
Why would the aliens give us chess?,0
Maybe the Chess grandmaster knows something we do not,0
"Yes, maybe he does, or maybe he is an alien trying to use reverse psychology to throw us off the scent!",0
LOL,0
Are you into football?,0
I sometimes watch football.,0
more than chess!,0
LOL,0
I'm sure a lot of people do!,0
Did you know ESPN won an Emmy for the yellow first down line,0
"Yeah, i heard that.",0
i guess they must have been the first to superimpose graphics on the field.,0
Yeah they completely recreate the playing surface.,0
Its pretty cool,0
"Yes, i see a lot of graphics on the field now.",0
quite useful for the viewers.,0
Football has come a long way.,0
Financially as well.,0
Professional bowlers use to make twice as much as players,0
"I think the football players made very little, so I don't know how much the bowlers made.",0
"Anyway, great chat!",0
I wonder if a pink locker room actually has an effect on players,0
I doubt it.,0
"well, maybe a small one.",0
"Anyway, great chat!",0
you as well have a great day!,0
Are you a Patriots fan or a fan of Trump?,0
I'm more of a Patriots fan than a fan of Donald Trump.,0
"Trump holds Kraft, Belichick and Brady in high regard; he has called them winners in the past",0
"Yes, Trump like's to associate himself with anything in the popular culture that is a winner.",0
But the Pats seem "self made" unlike the Donald.,0
The Patriots also know how to conduct themselves as winners and come back from behind.,0
"Yes, I see the parallel between the Falcons - Patriots Superbowl and Trump's victory in 2016.",0
I think that comparison is apt.,0
ESPN does not favor the Patriots nearly as much as Fox favors Trump,0
Hmmm.,0
Yes.,0
"I never knew that ESPN was against the Patriots, but they did really pump up Deflategate.",0
Funny that ESPN is seen as a rival of the Pats when they are based in Connecticut.,0
I think Deflategate was just a big distraction to other issues around the country,0
Sports new can be a big distraction.,0
Did you know that the Patriots were the NFL's whitest team?,0
Doesn't surprise me given where they are located,0
I would assume that them being white is just coincidence than someone contrived.,0
I have been a big fan of the Patriots since Brady starting playing,0
I'm amazed by Brady.,0
He's a pretty amazing story.,0
I don't really get the Patriots "hate" (if there is such a thing) across the country.,0
I think it goes to the fact the the Patriots under Bellichick have won over 20 post season games and are always on top season after season,0
Yes.,0
I have joined the bandwagon as a fan.,0
"I have to admit that I wanted the Rams to win the Patriots first Superbowl, though.",0
I was so mad when they were down to the Falcons a couple years back at halftime by 25 points.,0
I never thought they would come back,0
Probably the most amazing comeback in Superbowl history.,0
"In fact, I don't know if there's been a comeback in NFL history that has been so epic.",0
Atlanta will never forget for sure...lol,0
Where do you stand - was it more of an Atlanta "meltdown" or a New England come back?,0
Comeback for sure!,0
Do you follow the Patriots?,0
Good morning!,0
I follow the NFL very closely.,0
I am sick of the Patriots!,0
Hard to believe they were once lovable underdogs this century!,0
"Now they are the favorite at every turn, the owner gifted a jersey to our president",0
"Yea, I know Tom Brady keeps a MAGA hat in his locker during interviews.",0
Bob Kraft and Trump are good friends.,0
Kraft is a member at Mar A Lago.,0
"He does thats new to me, cray how prior to 2001 season they never won a title and now they are the team with the most Superbowl titles under their belt",0
"Yup, do you watch Game of Thrones at all?",0
"I thought it was hilarious the author called the Pats, ""the Lannisters of the NFL.""",0
I do watch it and that makes sense lol the Pats have dominated the league for many years now,0
It is crazy how dominant they have been.,0
15 AFC East titles in 17 years in a sport with that much free agency is just unfathomable!,0
15 out of 17 no kidding!!,0
that is amazing I dont think that will happen again in the history of the sport,0
"Yea, I would agree.",0
We will not see that again.,0
I did not know until recently Gillette Stadium is equidistant from Boston and Providence.,0
Always thought it was much closer to Boston.,0
"I love that stadium its the home stadium to our team, did you hear about Superbowl 46 and how the Pats let the giants score a touchdown?",0
"Yes, I remember that well.",0
"Bold strategy, but the Giants won anyway!",0
"Yeah the Giants didnt want to score but they ended up scoring, I wonder if Bill Belichick was the coach",0
He was the coach for that game.,0
"He has been the coach for the last 8 Patriots Super Bowl appearances, which is insane!",0
!,0
"He is a great coach, I guess part of the succes of the patriots is thanks to him, did you know the Patriots also hold the record for more Superbowl losses in the NFL",0
"Yes, I think they are actually tied with the poor Bills :(",0
"Yeah they hold the record with the Bills but at least we also hold the record of more Superbowl wins, not sure how many the Bills have won",0
"Yup, goes to show you how good you can be if you are fundamentally sound like the Pats are.",0
"For example, Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled once in his whole career!",0
What a stat!,0
"It is an amazing stat, he must be the only one in NFL history, skilled player, he retired back in 2011 right?",0
That sounds about right!,0
"A fun fact that not too many people know, the Browns last playoff win in 1995 was actually with Belichick as the head coach!",0
"Belichick is a great coach a leyend not only for the Patriots then, anyways its been great chatting with you, lots of cool facts",0
"Thanks, it was great chatting with you too!",0
Did you see the Patriots win the Superbowl?,0
yes did you know that at one point in 2001 they were the underdogs - the game now is amazing,0
I did not because it seems like they've been a dynasty forever now.,0
Did you know that George RR Martin called the Patriots the Lannisters of the NFL?,0
I think that's fitting.,0
"haha tat is funny, at this point they surely inspure envy and suspition with the scandals.",0
but yes at one point brady was the 199th pick - can you guess the year?,0
That's super shocking.,0
No what year was it?,0
2000 - he came from university of michigan.,0
funny with a democratic state trump loves them because they are 'winners',0
"Not for much longer, the stars are getting too old.",0
Everyone also forgets that they are tied with the Bills for the most super bowl losses.,0
"right and gillette stadium is actually in foxborough mass, about an hour from boston so its not quite a 'boston' team",0
They sure claim it.,0
Did you know that in the 1960's top bowler's made more money than top football players?,0
That's so strange.,0
i love those weird facts.,0
"like the giant american flags weigh 1100 pounds and cost 50,000 to make!",0
Wow!,0
I was not aware of that.,0
That's crazy.,0
Are you familiar with Benjarvus Green-Ellis from the Patriots?,0
no tell me more about him,0
He never fumbled a football in his entire career and he was a running back!,0
I don't know how that's possible.,0
that sounds impossible!,0
nearly as impossible is that th patriots have either won or lost by 3 or 4 points in all 6 tries,0
Those are close games.,0
Here's a fact about high scoring games.,0
The highest scoring football game was in 1916 between Georgia Tech and Cumberland and the score was 222-0!,0
"that is funny, poor cumberland.",0
last playoff for cleveland browns was 1995 against the patriots,0
I'm not surprised.,0
They were so excited when they won their first game this year because it had been so long.,0
Have you heard about the University of Iowa's locker room?,0
no is it cool?,0
They painted the visiting teams room pink.,0
I'm assuming that's some kind of psychological warfare.,0
oh no!,0
that would make me want to win more!,0
atleast the stadium didnt cost 60 million to build like a highschool in allen texas,0
That's insane.,0
I wonder how they got that money.,0
Especially if it's a public school.,0
Hey there do you like the New England Patriots?,0
And what do you think about Tom Brady?,0
I don't really care for the Patriots.,0
Nor for Tom Brady.,0
What do you think?,0
I do like the Patriots personally.,0
They do win all the time.,0
Do you like Game of Thrones?,0
The author of Game of Thrones does not like the Patriots apparently LOL,0
I haven't watched much of Game of Thrones or read the books.,0
Why didn't he like them?,0
"Well I don't know exactly, but I do watch The Game of Thrones, and he says the Patriots are like the Lannisters.",0
The Lannisters are definitely the bad guys in that show lol,0
Yikes that is a very unflattering comparison.,0
I think the patriots are the yankees of football.,0
Everyone loves to hate them.,0
Haha yes I can agree with you there.,0
Do you like the Buffalo Bills by the way?,0
"They are equivalent to the New York Patriots, in terms of Super Bowl losses haha",0
I haven't ever heard of them actually.,0
I'm a bit football illiterate.,0
Is there a coach that is known as like the best in the league?,0
"Yes I think that's Bill Belichick, I think he's the best in the league, and it is an amazing record.",0
He is the most winningest coach in the NFL postseason with 21 wins.,0
Wow that is quite a lot of wins.,0
What team does he coach for right now?,0
He coaches the New England Patriots.,0
And I think he'll be there coach again next year.,0
If they win again next year that would be insane!,0
What do you think about the Cleveland Browns by the way?,0
I can't say that I know much about them.,0
They are sort of one of those teams you hear about in passing but aren't any good so you dont' really give them a second thought.,0
Yeah that's true.,0
I guess their last playoff win was back in 1995. that seems like so long ago!,0
Wow that is almost a quarter of a centuary ago!,0
I know right!,0
"It doesn't seem that long ago, but it kind of was lol, did you hear about the pink locker room?",0
"You know, the one painted that way by the University of Iowa?",0
That is totally something I could see happening in Iowa.,0
They love to razz opposing teams.,0
I wonder if it works though?,0
"I would play a lot better if I were put in a pink locker room LOL, what about you?",0
I would find it hilarious.,0
I'm sure it was supposed to be some sort of play on pink being a girls color.,0
Who knows with it being Iowa though.,0
Yeah that's true.,0
have you gone bowling recently?,0
"Apparently bowling in the 60s, the top players made more than top football players, that's completely the opposite of now btw",0
It probably has a lot to do with the longevity of the career of a bowler vs a football player.,0
It seems like football players have such a short career due to all the injuries.,0
I think so.,0
"They need to be wise with their money so that it lasts them their whole life, just in case they get injured.",0
Did you hear about ESPN winning an Emmy?,0
Are you on Facebook?,0
"Used to be, but I got fed up with their shenanigans.",0
How long have you been on?,0
Since early days?,0
I was one of the first in 2006,0
Were you at least 13 years old then?,0
"Yes, much older than that unfortunately",0
I heard that Myspace said no to the chance to buy FB for $75 mil in 2005.,0
Oops.,0
Mark Zuckerberg seems to be digging himself a big hole at Facebook nowadays,0
"With all his cash, he could just buy an island and live there without worries.",0
Have you heard about the BK promotion?,0
I would unfriend and refriend to get many Whoppers.,0
I didn't hear that one.,0
Can you tell me more about it?,0
Burger King had a promotion where you'd get a free Whopper if you unfriended 10 people on FB.,0
Not sure what the point was.,0
Spread hate for your fast food cravings?,0
How would they know?,0
Did they run the promotion on the radio?,0
I guess you would have to show them on your phone or something.,0
Maybe there was a link on the website.,0
Does anyone listen to radio anymore?,0
Seems like YouTube is the only game around.,0
All it takes to make one is a razorblade and a pencil.,0
"If that radio got people ""likes"" on FB, it would be popular again.",0
Do you know what CanCon is?,0
I don't.,0
What is it?,0
Canadian Content.,0
"In Canada, 40% of music must be Canadian in origin.",0
Rush.,0
More Rush.,0
"I bet they play a lot of Justin Bieber, he is canadian I think.",0
"Yeah, he's Canadian.",0
Are you an NFL fan?,0
I absolutely love NFL.,0
I am watching game now,0
What game?,0
Is it the Patriots?,0
Denver Oakland; I hope they combine for the most points in a game tonight,0
"Got some money riding on it, eh?",0
Good luck!,0
"Hi, how are you doing today?",0
Great and yourself?,0
I'm doing great!,0
Do you use Facebook?,0
I do!,0
I never knew about the Like button being illegal in Germany!,0
Do you use Facebook?,0
I don't.,0
"Never really saw the appeal, but I understand it helps people stay in touch.",0
Myspace made a blunder.,0
How much money did they miss out on?,0
They could've bought it for 75 million and now it's worth 104 billion!,0
Do you watch football?,0
I sometimes watch.,0
It's an interesting sport.,0
"Do you watch American football, soccer, or rugby?",0
I didn't know an emmy could be won for a line LOL,0
"I watch American football around playoffs, and the World Cup for soccer.",0
I guess the line was an big breakthrough for the game.,0
I like it when I watch on tv.,0
What do you think about the University of Iowa having a pink locker room for the visiting team?,0
I would say that it's a cheap ploy to put the opposition in a softer mood.,0
Can't imagine it works now.,0
Do you prefer to watch the games on tv or listen to them on the radio?,0
Prefer the TV.,0
The radio is great for talk shows and for music.,0
And maybe the occasional weekly news program in classical Latin.,0
I would love to find the am station where you can hear the Jupiter radio storms.,0
That's crazy!,0
Probably better than most of the top 40 these days.,0
"The kids have their preferences, though.",0
I guess Jupiter storms are old school.,0
I wonder if classic radio dramas could ever make a comeback?,0
They say everything eventually comes back in style right?,0
I wonder if that's true in an age of video.,0
Maybe researchers and professors will take an interest.,0
"Maybe that's something that someone at Harvard can re-develop and look into and test it with Harvard students, much like Mark Zuckerberg did with Facebook",0
Put the Zuck on it.,0
See what happens.,0
Maybe get Burger King involved with a promotion  for a free whopper.,0
"Burger King doesn't need the promotion, they already give enough money to Facebook with their advertisements",0
True.,0
I enjoyed chatting!,0
Me too!,0
Have a great day!,0
Bye!,0
"Good morning, are you a football fan?",0
Hi there.,0
"I really don't enjoy it, but I went to a big football college in the SEC, so I'm familiar enough haha.",0
The SEC sure loves their football!,0
The schools have to bring in some much money from those games.,0
"They do, mostly from the broadcasting rights.",0
"The behind the scenes action can be pretty interesting, too--for example, the University of Iowa's visitor's locker room is painted pink.",0
I wonder if they thought it would give them an advantage psychologically?,0
I can't see that working though.,0
"If anything it's going to give the visiting team more motivation, right?",0
I wonder if teams of the variations of football in other countries try similar tactics.,0
I think at the highest level of sports that athletes are so tuned in that the only thing that might throw them off is their own mistake or the refs.,0
"Yes, for example, former Patriots QB Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled in his NFL career.",0
"That's an amazing stat and he had one of the best nicknames ever, The Law Firm.",0
That's certainly an interesting one; was it a reference to his offensive abilities?,0
It was because his name sounded like a law firm haha.,0
The Law Firm of Ben-Jarvis Green-Ellis.,0
"Yeah, that would make for a confusing on-air name as a broadcaster if people thought it was an advertisement, especially on the radio haha.",0
"Yes it would, it wasn't used a ton just to bring a little humor into the broadcast.",0
It would probably read easier on a platform like facebook--I don't think they have a character limit for names.,0
"I've never really explored that, my name isn't very long to begin with so I never ran into that issue.",0
"The site does have some interesting quirks; for example, the primary color is blue because Mark Zuckerberg is red-green colorblind",0
I remember an NFL game where the two teams wore red and green jerseys.,0
A lot of people who suffered from that complained because they could not tell who were on what team.,0
That's funny--maybe it's part of why a home team wears white a lot of the time.,0
"I don't think many NCAA teams have green as a color, although a lot have red, like Ohio State.",0
Yeah this was a special game where they were testing Color Rush jerseys that were primarily one color.,0
That's why so many people had trouble because there were no breaks in the color or noticeable logos.,0
"I guess they make some choices to make things easier on the viewers; for example, ESPN actually won an Emmy for the superimposed yellow first down line shown on TV.",0
That was a great invention that made watching the game a lot easier!,0
"It was fun talking football with you, have a great day!",0
Good Afternoon!,0
Hi there.,0
I just learned that a wealthy board member of the University of Virginia wanted to sponsor a shoe shopping day for female staff and some women were offended.,0
Virginia just cannot get a break.,0
Isn't that the truth!,0
What was the reason behind a female only shopping spree?,0
I hope it wasn't nefarious,0
It was to celebrate his Mom's 102 birthday.,0
The women objected because they want to choose the groups they associate with and this trip would jam them together arbitrarily.,0
Interesting!,0
The guy had to resign from the board.,0
He just wanted to express generosity and have some people have some fun.,0
It was a strange turn of events.,0
Like you said - nothing these days about the Commonwealth of Virginia surprises me any more!,0
That's amazing,0
"Speaking of shopping for shoes, Stephon Marbury promoted a line of shoes that cost $15 and took no money for the endorsement.",0
"Starbury is a good dude, he played here in Phoenix and did a lot of good stuff in the community and was pretty selfless.",0
"This does not surprise me, and I think I heard about it a while back.",0
Thought he was still playing in China?,0
I am in Ahwatukee myself.,0
Some shoes are safety equipment.,0
I have known men who wore steel toed shoes to protect against heavy items being dropped.,0
"For sure, very valuable in the construction industry!",0
I bet some of those shoes start to smell pretty bad after a few years of work!,0
Undoubtedly.,0
They say that dry tea bags will absorb the odor.,0
I wonder how long it takes.,0
I guess there's always a double use for everything every made in the world.,0
I wonder how these things are discovered?!?,0
!,0
Good point!,0
Did someone drop a tea bag and then did not notice it and one shoe smelled better compared to the other one?,0
Right!,0
I guess we'll never know if it was science or accidents - shoes are pretty weird when you think about how diverse they are and pretty much everyone has several pairs and types,0
NFL wide receiver Steve Smith would leave his pair of cleats on the field after each game to remind people of the homeless who don't have shoes.,0
Another good dude athlete!,0
I remember this gesture and how he didn't make a big deal about it until the media caught on.,0
I just heard about it recently.,0
I did see him do some interviews and he came across as a good guy.,0
I also read that 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes.,0
"Another one of those, ""How do the measure that?""",0
"Did someone walk a mile in someone's 5,000 year old shoes?",0
"Great point, and they couldn't have been comfortable!",0
"Yes, that's right.",0
"Years ago, shoes were more for function and there is some of that now like the steel toed ones.",0
"However, they are much more for fashion now than they used to be.",0
Fashion for sure and the prices for some are crazy - I've seen "designer" sneakers for $500 - that's ridiculous!,0
It sure is.,0
"When our kids moved out, I put in shoe racks and we now have a ""shoe room"" for my wife in what used to be a bedroom.",0
Nice conversation.,0
Thanks.,0
Hi!,0
Do you know a lot about shoes?,0
A decent amount.,0
What about you?,0
Do you have a shoe preference?,0
Not really.,0
I do have a problem though and maybe you can help me out.,0
My feet sweat really bad and they make my shoes smell really stinky.,0
Do you know of any tricks or tips I can do to help get rid of the unpleasant odor?,0
You can place dry tea bags in shoes and they will absorb the bad smell.,0
For real.,0
Thank you so much!,0
I was about to pass out from the stench.,0
I wonder how they know that 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes.,0
They must have tested them.,0
Leather shoes can be really resilient.,0
I bet.,0
Pro ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week.,0
I bet that gets expensive.,0
"Yes, but if they are professional, I think the ballet company pays for the shoes.",0
"Do you prefer functional shoes or decorative fashionable shoes, or both?",0
I'm a mixture of both.,0
Seems like the big money I spend for nice shoes ends up being a waste though because then I don't wear the shoes.,0
lol,0
Ha ha.,0
I like to buy moderately expensive high quality shoes on sale because they last longer.,0
Did you know that NFL player Steve Smith leaves his cleats on the field after every game to raise awareness about homeless people without shoes?,0
That's pretty cool of him to do that.,0
I feel terrible when I see homeless people.,0
I can't even imagine what goes through their minds every day.,0
Same.,0
I wonder if he raises money to buy shoes to give away?,0
He must.,0
I'll have to look it up.,0
Sephon Marbury promoted a line of shoes that retailed for $15 and he wasn't paid to endorse them.,0
I wonder if those were some kind of shoes for charity as well and that's why he did it for free?,0
I wonder.,0
Do you prefer American football or soccer or both?,0
I prefer football over soccer.,0
lol,0
I prefer soccer.,0
"I especially enjoy watching the World Cup games, both the men's and women's World Cups.",0
I'll watch the world cup games.,0
I wonder why americans call it soccer but the rest of the world calls it football?,0
Probably because elsewhere in the world they don't really watch American football.,0
Rugby is popular around the world though.,0
What is your favorite American football team?,0
My favorite team is the steelers.,0
Do you know what the highest scoring football game ever was?,0
I think it was in 1916 when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland 222-0!,0
Crazy!,0
No mercy for the other team!,0
p,0
Did you know that professional bowlers in the 1960s made 2 times more than current football stars?,0
Bowling must've been real popular then.,0
Wow.,0
It was along with baseball and horse racing.,0
Thanks for chatting!,0
"Sure, have a good day!",0
You too!,0
"I love shoes, in fact I have a collection of them",0
"Nice, are they as good as the 5000 years old ones?",0
"I dont think so lol, but they look nice that I can tell you",0
Nice :).,0
did you know ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of shoes a week?,0
"No I didnt, they must spend a fortune on shoes, good thing I dont like ballet lol",0
Yeah they must.,0
how to you keep your shoes free of smells,0
"I use a spry and also dry tea bags, its a great way to absorb all those bad smells, highly recommended",0
"Nice, good to know.",0
DO you know who steve smith is?,0
"No not really, who is he?",0
An nfl player who always leaves his cleats in the field after the game to raise awareness about homelessness,0
"Oh so thats him, I remember now his a wide receiver and not only a great player but it seems like a great person as well",0
yeah he is doing what he loves while doing something great for the community,0
I agree so do you also know the player Benjarvus Green Ellis?,0
"Yeah , he is the guy that never fumbled a football in his career",0
"Yeah the same one, he played for the Patriots, his one of the best players I have seen at least on the RB position.",0
Yeah that is amazing.,0
"U of Iowa locker room is apparently pink, the visitors one",0
"Thats funny, I wonder how the other teams take that, its hard to be tough in a pink room",0
I know it is supposed to be some kind of distraction i think,0
"I wonder if the tactic works, the other team might get angry because it seems a bit insulting anyways back in the 60s bowlers made more money than football players",0
"Yeah, I know.",0
Do you know who the wealthiest presidents of the us are?,0
"Im guessin Trump, JFK and Jefferson",0
"Actually trump is not in there, bu Washington is",0
"Oh I see, thats interesting, Trump is rich as hell or so it seems that way.",0
"Hello there, do you watch much television?",0
I love tv.,0
How about you.,0
Whats your favorite show.,0
"Yeah same here, I love tv.",0
"I would have to say either Seinfeld or the Simpsons are my all time favs, how about you?",0
Never cared for seinfeld myself.,0
I love the simpsons.,0
Did you know there is only one episode where bart isnt in the show or mentioned.,0
"I think I have heard about that before, but pretty sure I have never seen that one.",0
I have seen a lot of epeiodes of the simpsons.,0
I dont remember seeing that one either.,0
"Yeah I think Simpsons should have done like Seinfeld and quit while they were still very funny, I think after season 10 it started going downhill.",0
I never really thought seinfeld was funny.,0
I liked cramer he was funny.,0
I could wathc the simpsons anytime.,0
Homer is always funny.,0
Yeah the Simpsons is just classic.,0
Have you ever seen Pokemon?,0
I have not actually.,0
I do know there are over 750 episodes.,0
thats about 50 a year for 16 years.,0
It was pretty popular.,0
Yeah isn't that just crazy how many there are?,0
I wonder how they keep coming up with new material after all those shows.,0
Well I think there are thousands of different pokemon.,0
So they would have no shortage of characters toto make it new.,0
throw in,0
"Wow, well in that case yeah I guess they could just pick a character and make a few shows out of that.",0
Dont quote me on that number.,0
I know there are a lot of them though.,0
Were you a that 70s show fan?,0
"Yeah I really like that show when it first came out, have you ever seen it?",0
Yeah I thought it was pretty good.,0
I guess they remade it over in the UK.,0
It was canceled after 10 episodes.,0
"I heard it bombed over there when they tried yeah, I wonder why/",0
I guess it just didnt translate well.,0
They remade the show verbatim so it was exactly what we saw here.,0
Or maybe the actors werent very good.,0
"Yeah that could be it, I know the actors really made the show over here.",0
I know I enjoyed it over here.,0
Almost as much as my son loves Thomas the tank.,0
Yeah I heard that show has had some big names narrating.,0
"Anyways, it's been good talking with you, I hope you have a good day!",0
Good Morning!,0
Good morning.,0
How are you?,0
So did you get a chance to watch the winter olympics at all last year?,0
Yes I watched some of it.,0
My favorite is the ice skating.,0
I like the singles and the couples equally.,0
I like Adam Rippon!,0
I didn't get a chance to watch a ton of it.,0
I have small kids so I watch a lot of cartoons most nights but I did get to watch some.,0
I'm not a huge skating fan but I don't mind it whenever the Olympics come on.,0
Yeah Adam Rippon did pretty amazing.,0
You would never guess that these amazing people are so nervous.,0
They look so polished-like they never got scared.,0
Yeah it's true.,0
They do look real calm.,0
I feel like I would be freaking out if I were in that position.,0
I would fall flat on my face.,0
I did not know that he was gay.,0
That must put him in a position to help other people who are gay to be cool with it.,0
Yeah.,0
It seems like he used his sports platform to talk about the difficulties of being gay and the difficulties that a lot of younger people face.,0
"Yes, there is so much bullying that kids go through if they are different.",0
Yeah.,0
I always worry about bullying when my kids get older.,0
I know you can't protect your  kids forever but it's hard to see others treated badly because they may look or act different.,0
You have to stand behind them that's for sure.,0
My son is gay but he never got bullied because he came out after high school.,0
I have always stood behind him anyway.,0
In high school the other kids were scared of him because he was a fighter.,0
Well that's one way to deal with bullying.,0
Haha.,0
I think it is very important to stand behind your kids and let them know you love them no matter what.,0
Kids need family support.,0
"As long as they are being themselves, they will learn to stand up to bullying.",0
"Most bullies are cowards, anyway.",0
That's true.,0
I was looking at some interesting facts here.,0
"I didn't realize that the three wealthiest Presidents were JFK, Washington, and Jefferson.",0
But I guess the two oldest owned massive amounts of land I'm sure.,0
There was plenty of land to go around in those days.,0
And the Kennedys got rich on Irish whiskey.,0
I am from Massachusetts.,0
lol,0
I guess you would know then.,0
Haha.,0
I just went to a Museum in Virginia not too long ago about the early settlers and they pretty much just gave away land for free back then to anyone who would come and settle there.,0
Those were the days.,0
Yes.,0
I wish I was there.,0
That was a great enticement for people to come from Europe.,0
But it was hard living in those days.,0
Not so easy to settle a new country.,0
No.,0
It was very hard.,0
We got to walk around the old settlements and they definitely had to work very hard and pretty much everything they had was from the land they lived off of.,0
No grocery stores or Macys.,0
"haha Still, it must have been worth it because a lot of people came.",0
They didn't have any entertainment either.,0
No television and no Simpsons.,0
"Yeah, What did they do with all their free time.",0
Haha.,0
They definitely had a strong work ethic.,0
They had to or they wouldn't survive.,0
They probably didn't have free time.,0
Sunday mornings-but they all went to church.,0
You couldn't be lazy or you wouldn't eat.,0
"Well, I am going to head out here.",0
It was very nice chatting with you today.,0
Thank you-have a great day.,0
Don't work too hard!,0
I'll try not too.,0
Do you watch television at all?,0
I do.,0
"I like comedies, how about you?",0
I like comedies and dramas.,0
Not big on Pokemon though,0
Me neither.,0
But some people must like it since they made 750 episodes!,0
I guess kids will watch anything.,0
Have you watched That 70s Show?,0
I have.,0
I heard it was remade in the UK and got cancelled!,0
I'm not surprised.,0
The show was very American.,0
Sometimes it works well the other way.,0
Three's Company was based on a UK show.,0
That's true.,0
I didn't realize that.,0
Would you watch a show that used chickens to entertain audiences?,0
I don't think so.,0
Haha.,0
Cesar learned about chickens as entertainment in Britain.,0
Strange because chickens are so tasty.,0
People do a lot of different things for entertainment!,0
Do you play video games?,0
I used to play.,0
Don't play now.,0
What's your favorite system?,0
I had an old Nintendo.,0
They finally discontinued it in 2003.,0
"Very popular system, even though it had only 54 colors.",0
Much better than the Gameboy.,0
I wonder if they have video games at the White House?,0
"If there are kids in the White House, sure.",0
Trump tends to watch TV a lot.,0
I don't think he plays games.,0
I heard the guest house is bigger than the White House itself.,0
I guess they have a lot of visitors.,0
"These days, guests are probably getting fast food because of the gov't shut down.",0
That's true!,0
It used to be that the runner up of the election became the Vice President!,0
That would never work these days.,0
I imagine a lot of fighting all the time.,0
"Yeah, I can see that!",0
"I learned a lot from you, thanks for chatting!",0
Do you watch a lot of TV?,0
I do!,0
"I love game shows and sitcoms, but I am also a big fan of some cartoons.",0
What cartoons do you like?,0
"I really like American Dad, but some of the older episodes of South Park are really great.",0
"Did you know that when they aired their Family Guy episode, they received flowers from the crew of The Simpsons?",0
"I did not, it seems like they have a good relationship, thats great they are rivals but no need to fight",0
I think it's a pretty well-shared opinion in the cartoon world that Family Guy is a lazy show because so much of its humor is non-sequiturs.,0
Have you ever watched Pokemon?,0
"I have, got to catch them all right?",0
seems a bit impossible at this point,0
"Yes, kind of like 'catching' all of the undocumented immigrants, as some might put it.",0
Did you see any of the President's speech on border security on TV today?,0
"I did, it seems like a waste of money to me, nor really worth it, do you support Trump?",0
Definitely not!,0
"It's odd that he claims he knows how to run a country on the basis that he's a rich businessman, and yet he's not even one of the three wealthiest presidents (JFK, Washington, Jefferson)",0
"Yeah, I think he is too stuborn and does whatever he wants.",0
His guest house is larger than the white house its hard to believe he's not on that list,0
I guess it's kind of ironic that a man who owns all those hotels lives in a house smaller than his guest house haha.,0
I bet he'd prefer an authoritarian regime where he could be a dictator who's just called a president.,0
"Yeah I agree it is ironic indeed, you know that up untill 1805 the runner up of an election would become Vice President!!",0
!,0
Can you imagine Hillary Clinton as Trump's VP?,0
Now that would be some can't miss entertainment!,0
That would definitely hold the national audience's interest.,0
"We would have a civil war almost every week lol, its a good thing that has changed now, in my opinion Trump should use his time to record pop albums instead of trying to build an expensive and useless wall",0
"Yes, The President Show on Comedy Central actually had a Christmas special that featured a fake Trump holiday album.",0
"If he didn't spend so much time on Twitter, maybe he could release 3 albums like the president of Indonesia has while in office",0
That would be a great idea I might buy the album and maybe Trump will make it to the top 3 rank with the money of the sales,0
"Yes, that would be one way to make money.",0
Did you know that Ronald Reagan was once rejected for a movie role because he didn't look presidential enough?,0
I wish that had happened with voters and Trump!,0
"That is ironic lol, and I hope Trump doesn't get re-elected.",0
I really don't understand why people vote for him.,0
I hope not!,0
"The first president of Zimbabwe was called President Banana, and based on the little I've read about him it seems like he wasn't a very effective leader and the country is still negatively impacted by his time in office.",0
"So enough politics and more entertainment, did you ever own a nintendo system?",0
"I did a long time ago, and SNES, too.",0
Too bad they stopped making those consoles.,0
"Yeah they stopped making them back in 2003, its a shame but theres more advanced systems now",0
"Yes, they display far more than the 54 colors the original had.",0
"Hi, how are you?",0
Well thank you.,0
Do you enjoy any sports?,0
I enjoy all sports.,0
What about you?,0
I especially enjoy football and baseball.,0
Do you enjoy any in particular?,0
I really enjoy those.,0
I like college and the NFL.,0
Football and the nfl are both very popular in the US.,0
14 of 25 of the largest stadiums belong to college football teams.,0
"Wow, I did not know it was that many.",0
I know Michigan and OSU have huge stadiums but I am not sure I could name more.,0
"Maybe Oklahoma, Texas, Alabama??",0
I mean a high school football stadium in texas with 18K seats cost 60 million to build.,0
Imagine how much it too to build those big college stadiums.,0
Yeah!,0
College teams have huge boosters though.,0
Like Oregon has Phil Knight and Oklahoma State has T Booke Pickens...,0
These stadiums sure are a large investment.,0
Even the huge american flags alone are 50k a pop,0
That much!!!,0
Holy cow!,0
I wonder how much the pink paint iowa used to paint the visitors locker room cost?,0
I wonder if baseball stadiums cost just as much?,0
"No, not in college, They do not need the infrastructure that foot ball needs, in terms of seating.",0
Really?,0
I though even college baseball have large stadiums.,0
"In any case, did you know a typical season uses up to 160k baseballs?",0
That many!,0
I went to a big ten school and they had maybe 100 people at the games.,0
It was sparce...,0
Really?,0
"I imagined college baseball to be 3rd, only behind football and soccer, having at least several hundred to a thousand",0
Not at Illinois...,0
There was a guy who found $3M in baseball cards in his grandpa's attic!,0
Man it seems like forgotten attics are actually treasure troves.,0
"While I enjoy baseball, it seems they haven't done a good job making it far for women.",0
A 17 year old female pitcher was banned from professional baseball after she struck out babe ruth and lou gehrig,0
Banned for that?,0
Are attics going to be the new storage unit?,0
Perhaps.,0
"On a different note, baseball have more fair rules to keep players from making bad choices.",0
"For instance if a player catches a baseball in their hat, the opposing team gets 3 bases.",0
That would make it more fun.,0
Nice chatting with you!,0
Are you a fan of football by any chance?,0
"Yes I actually am, I am a fan of the Patriots, what about you?",0
I am.,0
Bears fan here.,0
Were you aware that the Patriots had a player that never fumbled the ball his entire career?,0
"I am aware I became a fan because of him, Benjarvus Green Ellis, what a great player.",0
That is such a shocking statistic.,0
He was a running back right?,0
"Yeah he was a running back that is correct, did you hear about the team that lost by 222 points, that was a serious defeat!",0
I did.,0
